# Triple Triad
A local multiplayer version of the Final Fantasy card minigame Triple Triad built in Unity.

This is a personal project created for fun, and is still a work in progress.

Current improvement plans:
* importing card values rather than have them randomized
* improve the UI by adding art, changing colors, and moving the card values together
